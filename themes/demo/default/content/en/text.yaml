FOOTER_ABOUT_TITLE: What Is Carmel?
FOOTER_ABOUT_BODY:  Carmel is a free and open-source project that you can start using right away in your next project. It was designed from the ground up to make building websites as easy as possible. It's fast, lightweight and static - which means that it doesn't require a backend server to run your site. Just pick a theme, customize it to your liking, add your text, build, preview and then publish. It's as easy as that.
